accelowatch
===========

**A CSS automatic wristwatch that's (sort of) powered by your accelerometer**

#### Demo

[Live demo](http://sergiioo.github.io/accelowatch "GitHub pages accelowatch live demo")  hosted on github pages.

Works best on devices with an accelerometer, as that's how you "wind" the spring.

#### Development

###### Prerequisites
Recent node

* Clone the repo and install the npm dependencies with:

`npm install`

* Install gulp globally with:

`npm install gulp --global`

* Build the application into the dist directory and run a local (browser-sync) server using:

`gulp`

Now you can gawp at your newly opened default browser window and marvel at the intriguing juxtaposition of the old (mechanical watch movement) with the new (shiny CSS) contained within.
