Prerequisites: recent node

1. Clone the repo and install the npm dependencies with:

`npm install`

2. Install gulp globally with:

`npm install gulp --global`

3. Build the application into the dist directory and run a local (browser-sync) server using:

`gulp`

4. Gawp at your newly opened default browser window and marvel at the intriguing juxtaposition of the old (mecahnical watch movement) with the new (shiny CSS) contained withins.
